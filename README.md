# Albus DeFi

At the current stage, Albus DeFi is a platform for testing Albus Protocol, specifically how it operates in scenarios of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and due diligence (DD) checks, when integrated with a DeFi protocol. In the future, Albus DeFi may become a fully fledged DeFi protocol with native identity verification capabilities.
